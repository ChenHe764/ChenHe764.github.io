Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Management Science and Engineering (MS&E)](https://msande.stanford.edu/)
at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), hosted by [Prof. Jose Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche/).
I am a member of the [Stanford Operations Research Group](https://or.stanford.edu/).

Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree in [Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/)
from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised 
by [Prof. Anthony Man-Cho So](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/). From Aug 2020 to Mar 2021, I worked with [Prof. Justin Solomon](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/)
as a visiting Ph.D student in the [Geometric Data Processing Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/index.html) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 
Prior to joining CUHK, I obtained my bachelor degree in Statistics from Chongqing University.


# Research Interests 
My research focuses on continuous optimization and its interplay with machine learning, operations research and  data science. 
More specifically, I focus on the algorithmic and theoretical foundations for data-driven decision making and robust machine learning. 


> Feel free to drop me a message if you are interested in my research. (Remote) collaboration is also welcome!

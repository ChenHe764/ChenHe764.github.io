Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Department of Management Science and Engineering (MS&E)](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), hosted by [Prof. Jose Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche/). I also work closely with [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/).  Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree in [Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Anthony Man-Cho So](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/). From Aug 2020 to Mar 2021, I worked with [Prof. Justin Solomon](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/) as a visiting Ph.D student in the [Geometric Data Processing Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/index.html) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Prior to joining CUHK, I obtained my bachelor degree in Statistics from Chongqing University.


# Research Interests 

My research resides at the intersection of **mathematical optimization** and **machine learning**. I primarily concentrate on the theoretical and computational underpinnings required to solve data-driven decision-making problems. My specific areas of focus include:

- Theoretical foundations of nonsmooth, nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization:  Convergence analysis and algorithmic design;
- Distributionally robust optimization: Aiming for a  unified approach with computational tractability; 
- Optimization within probability spaces employing Wasserstein geometry;
-  Large-scale computational challenges in optimal transport with applications to graph learning.

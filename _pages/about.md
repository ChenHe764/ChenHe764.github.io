I am a PhD student in [SEEM](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at the[Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Anthony Man-Cho So](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree from School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University.
